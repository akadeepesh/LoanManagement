# Contributing to LoanManagement

First off, thank you for considering contributing to LoanManagement! It's people like you that make LoanManagement such a great tool. We welcome contributions from everyone.

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
- Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

1. Create a branch from where you want to base your work.

   - This is usually the `main` branch.
   - To quickly create a branch based on main, use:
     `git checkout -b feature/my-contribution main`
   - Please avoid working directly on the `main` branch.

2. Make commits of logical and atomic units.

3. Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.

4. Make sure your commit messages are clear and descriptive.

5. Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes, if applicable.

6. Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Submitting Changes

1. Push your changes to your fork of the repository.

2. Submit a pull request to the main LoanManagement repository.

3. The core team looks at pull requests on a regular basis and will provide feedback.

## Coding Conventions

- We use ESLint for maintaining code quality. Please ensure your code adheres to the project's ESLint configuration.

- For ensuring proper Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), we use a `withAuth` component. All pages should be exported like this:

  ```typescript
  export default withAuth(EditApplication, ["user"]);
  ```

  The second parameter specifies the role(s) that can access the page.

- Before submitting a pull request, please run `npm run build` locally to ensure there are no build errors.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.

2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.

3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
